# Implementation Status

**Updated after every phase.** Legend: `Not started` · `In progress` · `Implemented` · `Tested` · `Blocked`

"**Tested**" means an automated test exists **and was executed green**, with evidence recorded in §3. Code merely existing is never "Tested" (blueprint §27: *"do not claim completion based only on code existing"*).

**App version:** 0.1.0
**Last updated:** 2026-07-15 — end of Phase 1

## 2. Definition of Done (blueprint §25) — every item tracked

### Application

| # | Item | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | Application name is Different Network Transcribe | **Tested** — `test_main_window_opens_empty` asserts the window title |
| A2 | Indonesian UI | In progress — all strings centralised in `app/resources/strings_id.py`; sections land in Phase 9 |
| A3 | Four simple navigation sections | Not started (Phase 9) |
| A4 | First-run wizard | Not started (Phase 9) |
| A5 | Small/Medium choice | Not started (Phase 6/9) |
| A6 | No manual Python installation | Not started (Phase 11) |
| A7 | No terminal required | Not started (Phase 11) |
| A8 | UI stays responsive | In progress — worker is a separate process by construction; measured in Phase 9 |
| A9 | Separate worker | In progress — process boundary + `--worker` dispatch exist and are enforced by tests; runtime lands in Phase 6 |
| A10 | Duplicate workers blocked | Not started (Phase 6) |

**Toolchain verified (measured, not assumed):**

```text

```

**Safe inspection of real data (counts only, no content read, nothing modified).**
The corpus path is intentionally omitted from this public repository:

```text
  .opus     13,126        .txt (chat exports)   353
  .nomedia     110        .json                   1
  .wav           1        zero-byte files       109
  subfolders   110        total size         0.50 GB
```

**Privacy controls active before any code was written:** `.gitignore` committed first, excluding all audio extensions, `*.sqlite3`, `*.dntbackup`, `Output/`, `Logs/`, `Backups/`, `Models/`, `Temp/`, `real-fixtures/`.

**Boundary compliance:** No transcription run. No file in `D:\vn` opened for reading content. No data uploaded. No cloud API contacted.

### 3.1 — Phase 1 (complete)

**Gate: "application opens empty; tests run."**

Evidence — the real entry point, launched as a real process, rendering a real window:

```text
> python -m app.main --data-dir <temp> --self-test
INFO ui: ui starting
INFO ui: self-test finished
SELF_TEST PASS visible=True title='Different Network Transcribe' platform='windows' version=0.1.0
exit code: 0
```

The `--self-test` flag opens the window, confirms it rendered, and exits. It is reused by the
Phase 11 packaging gate to prove the installed build and portable ZIP start with no system Python.

**Quality gate:**

```text
ruff check app worker tests scripts   All checks passed!
mypy app worker                       Success: no issues found in 20 source files
pytest -m "not realdata"              40 passed
scripts/scan_private_data.py          PASSED — 46 git-tracked files, no private data
```

**Defects found and fixed during this phase (not hidden):**

1. The private-data scanner **failed on my own design documents** — `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`,
   `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` and `docs/TEST_MATRIX.md` had embedded the operator's real corpus
   path and a `C:\Users\<name>` path. In a public repository, git history is permanent, so these were
   removed before the first push. The scanner earned its place on day one.
2. Two architecture tests were initially matching their **own docstrings** rather than real code.
   Fixed by parsing module-level imports via AST and excluding docstring constants.
3. `os.replace` / `datetime.timezone.utc` / `os.path.expanduser` lint findings and one mypy
   `int()` argument-type error — all fixed, none suppressed.

**Delivered:** `pyproject.toml`, `requirements-lock.txt`, `app/version.py`, `app/paths.py`,
`app/config.py` (TOML, validated, last-known-good, unknown-field preservation),
`app/logging_setup.py` (JSONL, privacy filter), `app/main.py` (dual-role entry point),
`app/ui/launch.py`, `app/resources/strings_id.py`, `worker/main.py` (Qt-free bootstrap),
`scripts/{setup-dev,test}.ps1`, `scripts/scan_private_data.py`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## 4. Known gaps / blocked items

| Item | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `gh` CLI on PATH | Deferred | Installed but needs a shell restart. Only needed at Phase 12. |
| Code-signing certificate | Accepted risk | None available. SmartScreen will warn on the unsigned installer. Documented in `RISKS_AND_ASSUMPTIONS.md` R-07 and will be stated in `README.md`. |
